Itâ€™s defined this way on the Cash Flow Statement because Working Capital is a Net Asset, and when an Asset increases, the company must spend cash to do so. For example, think about Inventory: if it goes up, and no other items change, the company must have spent some of its cash to purchase this Inventory.

Therefore, if Working Capital increases, the companyâ€™s cash flow decreases, and if Working Capital decreases, the companyâ€™s cash flow increases.

That explains why the Change in Working Capital has a negative sign when Working Capital increases, while it has a positive sign when Working Capital decreases.

The Change in Working Capital gives you an idea of how much a companyâ€™s cash flow will differ from its Net Income (i.e., after-tax profits), and companies with more power to collect cash quickly from customers and delay payments to suppliers tend to have more positive Change in Working Capital figures.",change_in_working_capital,"https://breakingintowallstreet.com/biws/kb/financial-statement-analysis/change-in-working-capital/#:~:text=Change%20in%20Working%20Capital%20Summary,Operational%20Assets%20%E2%80%93%20Current%20Operational%20Liabilities.",

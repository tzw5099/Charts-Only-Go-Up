89,10,changeInWorkingCapital,Cash Flow Statement,"Change in Working Capital Summary: On the Cash Flow Statement, the Change in Working Capital is defined as Old Working Capital – New Working Capital, where Working Capital = Current Operational Assets – Current Operational Liabilities.

It’s defined this way on the Cash Flow Statement because Working Capital is a Net Asset, and when an Asset increases, the company must spend cash to do so. For example, think about Inventory: if it goes up, and no other items change, the company must have spent some of its cash to purchase this Inventory.

Therefore, if Working Capital increases, the company’s cash flow decreases, and if Working Capital decreases, the company’s cash flow increases.

That explains why the Change in Working Capital has a negative sign when Working Capital increases, while it has a positive sign when Working Capital decreases.

The Change in Working Capital gives you an idea of how much a company’s cash flow will differ from its Net Income (i.e., after-tax profits), and companies with more power to collect cash quickly from customers and delay payments to suppliers tend to have more positive Change in Working Capital figures.",change_in_working_capital,"https://breakingintowallstreet.com/biws/kb/financial-statement-analysis/change-in-working-capital/#:~:text=Change%20in%20Working%20Capital%20Summary,Operational%20Assets%20%E2%80%93%20Current%20Operational%20Liabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
